    In order to fight the game’s most dangerous enemies, your characters will have to be at a high level. You can achieve this by solving puzzles. Solving a character’s puzzles increases the level of that character. For example, whenever you solve a Cleric puzzle, your Cleric will gain a level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each puzzle requires a minimum level to view, so solving character puzzles may unlock more character puzzles. When all of a character’s puzzle answers are combined, they form a metapuzzle that can be solved to reveal that character’s special ability. Once you have revealed all of your party’s special abilities, you can confront the sorcerer.

    Once your party has a high enough total level, you will unlock quests. Each quest consists of puzzles and a metapuzzle. Quest puzzles also have a required character level for viewing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving a quest puzzle will give you loot in the form of gold or items. Gold can be exchanged for puzzle hints.
  </p>

    Solving a quest metapuzzle will level up all of your characters.

    There will be four training events while you solve. Each event levels up all of your characters. The first two events will earn your characters one level each, while the last two will earn your characters two levels each.
