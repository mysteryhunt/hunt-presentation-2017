    To properly fill the diagramless puzzle, solvers must leave all Cs out of the grid. (The clues are also written without the letter C.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The completed grid is in the shape of MIT Buildings 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10. There is one X in the completed grid, located at a point in a hallway in Building 2. That location features a wall, pictured below, with the word FACULTY at the top of it. Removing
    the C gives the answer <b>FAULTY</b>.
