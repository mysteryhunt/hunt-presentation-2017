    The title of this puzzle is a reference not only to The Great Gatsby, but also to Gadsby, a novel famous for not using the letter E. Each highlighted section, taken in conjunction with the accompanying note, forms a single letter lipogram - it contains
    every letter in the alphabet except for one.
