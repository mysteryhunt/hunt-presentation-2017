      As hinted, these &ldquo;Shakespearean&rdquo; quotes are actually taglines from cast
      members in the <i>Real Housewives</i> franchise on Bravo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &rdquo;character&rdquo; names, which are made up, are the same length as the
      actual Housewife names, and they share one letter in common in the same
      position. If the clues are ordered by city name alphabetically, as
      suggested by the final line (from Atlanta to Potomac), the letters spell
      out the phrase LADY LAIUS, cluing the answer, another famous &ldquo;wife&rdquo; from
      drama, <b>JOCASTA</b>.
