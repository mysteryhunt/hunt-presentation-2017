    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      This is a standard, 4-player game of the board game 7 Wonders. The
      position of the players and their starting cities are given. Also given
      are the four actions taken on each turn, although (with a few exceptions)
      it is not specified who took which action. The entire game can be
      logically reconstructed (see below for detailed walkthrough) from this
      information. The proper assignment is:
    </p>
    <p>
      HRAO<br>
      HAOR<br>
      AHOR<br>
      RHOA<br>
      ROHA<br>
      ARHO
    </p>
    <p>
      HAOR<br>
      AOHR<br>
      AOHR<br>
      RHAO<br>
      AROH<br>
      ARHO
    </p>
    <p>
      HROA<br>
      OHRA<br>
      ROAH<br>
      ORAH<br>
      AORH<br>
      ORAH
    </p>
    <p>
      At game's end, the scoresheet looks like:
    </p>
    <table class="s">
      <tr><th>H</th><th>A</th><th>O</th><th>R</th></tr>
      <tr><td>-2</td><td>2</td><td>18</td><td>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr>
      <tr><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>29</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>24</td><td>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>26</td><td>21</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
      <tr class="l"><td>46</td><td>38</td><td>53</td><td>41</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Applying the transformations from the scoresheet image and converting 1 to
      A, 2 to B, etc. gives the message COINS BETWEEN AGES (SPELL OUT THE
      DIGIT). Looking at the number of coins each player has at the points
      between Ages I/II and II/III, again converting to letters, and reading in
      the same order around the table, gives the phrase GAME NAME. The "game
      name" is of course "7 Wonders", and spelling out the digit as instructed
      yields the final answer <b>SEVEN WONDERS</b>.

    <h3>Detailed Logic Walkthrough</h3>
    <p>
      To begin, there appears to be no papyrus until the Press appears in II-5.
      So how does the Scriptorium get built in I-4?  This is only possible if a
      Press has entered the game before I-4, and the only way that can happen is
      if Hal builds a press using the first stage of his wonder in
      I-3. (Incidentally this Press must have been the card sold in I-2).
    </p>
    <p>
      With that established, we turn our attention to clay.  The only card that
      can produce clay is the Caravansery built in II-6.  The first stage of
      Hal's wonder is spoken for, and he can't reach the second stage without
      multiple clay.  Thus no other clay-producing card can ever enter the game,
      and no one will spend clay on any purchase, other than potentially the
      owner of the Caravansery during Age III.
    </p>
    <p>
      In I-3, there are not yet two stone in the game, so Alex can't build her
      first stage.  Thus the other three must, and Alex builds the Theater in
      I-3.  Nobody can build the second stage of their wonder in I-5 (Hal and
      Rhoda would need clay, Alex can't access Rhoda's gold), so Alex builds her
      first stage in I-5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex, Ollie, and Rhoda must all have access to the Timber Yard in order to
      build their first stages, so the Timber Yard must be played by Ollie in
      I-2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda's I-1 play is known, so she must make a play in I-2 that allows her
      to buy two wood from Ollie in I-3 to build her first stage.  Thus Rhoda
      sells a card in I-2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal needs to get two ore from Rhoda in I-3 to build his first stage.  The
      remaining available cards in I-2 are no help, so he can only afford this
      if he builds the East Trading Post in I-1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that we know the eventual locations of all the resources in Age I,
      except the Stone Pit.  So we can briefly look ahead to Age II. The
      Training Ground in II-1 cannot be built by Hal (no access to wood) or Alex
      (no access to gold), therefore it is built by Rhoda.  The Courthouse in
      II-1 must be built via chain (no clay), so it must be built by the player
      who played the Scriptorium in I-4.  This can't be Alex (who plays a
      different card in I-4), therefore it is Hal who plays the Courthouse in
      II-1 and the Scriptorium in 1-4.  By elimination, Alex plays the
      Glassworks in II-1.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stone Pit in I-4 must be played where Alex can access it for her
      wonder stage buy in I-5, therefore it is played by Ollie and not Rhoda.
      Rhoda plays the Altar in I-4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal cannot play the Baths in I-5 (no access to stone), so Rhoda does.  Hal
      sells in I-5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now consider Alex's money situation heading into I-5.  She needs two coins
      to pay for her wonder stage (using the West Trading Post), and no one can
      pay her any money before this (the only resource she has is glass, and the
      only card which requires glass is the Workshop which doesn't appear until
      I-6).  Thus she cannot afford to pay two coins for either the Stockade in
      I-1 or the Apothecary in I-2 and still have enough money to pay for her
      wonder stage in I-5.  Therefore Alex buys the Pawnshop in I-1 and the
      Marketplace in I-2. By elimination, Ollie plays the Stockade in I-1 and
      Hal plays the Apothecary in 1-2.
    </p>
    <p>
      In II-2, the Temple must be built via chain (no clay) by Rhoda.  The
      Stables in II-2 must be built via chain (no clay) by Hal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal cannot play the Aqueduct or Walls (can't access enough stone) in II-4,
      or the School (no access to wood), therefore he plays the Dispensary in
      II-4.  That means he cannot play the Dispensary in II-3; neither can Alex
      (no access to gold) or Rhoda (no access to glass).  Therefore Ollie plays
      the Dispensary in II-3.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Laboratory in II-2 must be built by chain from the Workshop in I-6,
      this leaves only Alex or Ollie as potentially playing the Workshop.
      Therefore Hal and Rhoda cannot buy the Archery Range by chain in II-3.
      Can either buy it by resources?  Hal cannot (no access to wood).  Rhoda
      has two coins after I-5, and spends two coins in II-1.  She can earn at
      most three coins from selling in I-6, and cannot earn any money in II-2
      (no one buying gold).  Thus she has at most three coins in II-3, and
      cannot afford the Archery Range (which would cost her four).  Therefore
      Alex plays the Archery Range in II-3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex has no access to gold, so she must have bought the Archery Range via
      chain.  Therefore Alex played the Workshop in I-6; the others sold cards
      in I-6.  Alex plays the Laboratory in II-2 by chain. By elimination, Ollie
      plays the Quarry in II-2.
    </p>
    <p>
      In II-3, Rhoda, with three coins, cannot afford the Library; Rhoda plays
      the Loom and Hal plays the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      In II-4, Alex, with three coins, cannot afford the Walls or Aqueduct; Alex
      plays the School.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Forum in II-5 must be bought by chain, and Hal is already selling a
      card, so Alex builds the Forum.  By elimination, Ollie sells a card in
      II-5.
    </p>
    <p>
      In II-6, the second stage wonder cannot be built by Alex (no access to
      gold) or Hal or Rhoda (no clay); it is built by Ollie.  With no wood, Hal
      cannot build the Caravansery or the Statue in II-6; he sells a card.  The
      Statue cannot be built by Alex (no gold); it is built by Rhoda.  Alex
      plays the Caravansery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda must pay two coins to build the Statue in II-6, and she has seven
      coins after II-3.  Thus she cannot spend six coins on the Walls in II-4.
      Rhoda plays the Aqueduct in II-4 and Ollie plays the Walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Age III, Hal's plays each turn are essentially forced from the fact
      that he has no access to wood or stone.  He must play the Lodge, Senate,
      University, Observatory, and Traders Guild on turns 2-6, and thus must
      play the Arena on turn 1 (not a second Observatory).
    </p>
    <p>
      In III-1, Alex, with one coin, cannot afford the Arsenal or Shipowners
      Guild, so she plays the University.  Rhoda cannot play the Shipowners
      Guild (no access to glass) so she plays the Arsenal, and Ollie the
      Shipowners Guild.
    </p>
    <p>
      In III-6, Rhoda cannot play the Siege Workshop or Arsenal (already has
      one); she plays the Gardens.  The Siege Workshop must be played by chain
      (not enough clay), so it is played by Alex.  By elimination, Ollie plays
      the Arsenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In III-2, Alex cannot buy the Gardens (no clay) or the Strategists Guild
      (no second gold), so she plays the Town Hall.  Rhoda can't play the
      Gardens in III-2 (she plays it in III-6), so she plays the Strategists
      Guild.  Ollie plays the Gardens, which he must do using his one free buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In III-3, Alex, being broke, cannot afford the Fortifications or the
      Circus; she plays the Haven.  Rhoda, with one coin, cannot afford the
      Fortifications; she plays the Circus.  Ollie plays the Fortifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pantheon in III-4 must be played by chain (no second clay) by Rhoda.
      Alex, unable to afford the Magistrates Guild (still broke), plays the
      Study.  Ollie plays the Magistrates Guild.
    </p>
    <p>
      In III-5, Alex, still broke, cannot afford the Craftsmens Guild and has
      already built a Haven; she plays the Academy.  Rhoda, with three coins,
      cannot quite afford the Craftsmens Guild; she plays the Haven.  Ollie
      plays the Craftsmens Guild.
