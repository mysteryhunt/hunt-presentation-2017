    <p>
      Each quatrain in the verse (all of which have rhyme scheme ABBA)
      indicates a song by the group ABBA. Reading the first words in each
      line gives these instructions:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      SWEDISH POP FOUR SOME<br>
      EACH FOUR LINES INDICATES<br>
      ONE OF THEIR HITS<br>
      LOOK AT LAST WORDS<br>
      FIND WHERE THEY'RE FROM<br>
      WHAT'S THE RHYME SCHEME<br>
      THAT GIVES THE GROUP
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The last words in each quatrain are rhymes taken from a particular
      ABBA song. In order, these are:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Waterloo": more/war, refuse/lose<br>
      "Angeleyes": way/say, river/shiver<br>
      "I Have a Dream": fail/tail, me/see<br>
      "Take a Chance on Me": try/lie, line/mind<br>
      "Eagle": spell/tell, wing/everything<br>
      "Ring Ring": right/night, call/all<br>
      "SOS": near/fear, understood/good
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The first letters of these song titles spell <b>WAITERS</b>, the
      answer to this puzzle.
    </p>
