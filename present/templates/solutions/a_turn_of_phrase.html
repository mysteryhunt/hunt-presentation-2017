  <p>Each of these is a clue for a two-word phrase. When you solve as many of them as you can, you see they are all odd phrases, BUT if you spoonerize each phrase, it gives a word and a number.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Propulsion unit for an apian insect = BEE THRUSTER = BUSTER THREE = S</li>
    <li>Dandy who loves doing household tasks = CHORE FOP = CHOP FOUR = P</li>
    <li>Toss of some soft surface-ripened French cheese = BRIE THROW = BRO THREE = O</li>
    <li>Military upheaval over a hard, buttery sweet = TOFFEE COUP = COFFEE TWO = O</li>
    <li>Young unweaned animal from Exeter&rsquo;s county = DEVON SUCKLING = DUCKLING SEVEN = N</li>
    <li>Open land area along the water = SHORE FIELD = SHIELD FOUR = E</li>
    <li>One who puts &ldquo;have a formal meal&rdquo; into the choices for voting = DINE NOMINATOR = DOMINATOR NINE = R</li>
    <li>Visualize a twisted filament for sewing = SEE THREAD = SAID THREE = I</li>
    <li>Cause ennui for some lint = BORE FUZZ = BUZZ FOUR = Z</li>
    <li>Get former IAEA head Hans drunk = SOUSE BLIX = BLOUSE SIX = E</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Sonnet X/Death Be Not Proud,&rdquo; e.g. = DONNE WORK = DIRK ONE = D</li>
    <li>Tiny arachnids with an unhealthy yellow-brown complexion = SALLOW TICKS = TALLOW SIX = W</li>
    <li>Clothing trend inspired by Katy Perry's jungle-themed music video = ROAR FASHION = FOUR RATION - I</li>
    <li>Ring-shaped sewer covering lattice = ANNULAR GRATE = GRANULAR EIGHT = R</li>
    <li>Famed Roman general and leader&rsquo;s candy bar of biscuit and caramel = CAESAR TWIX = TWEEZER SIX = E</li>
    <li>Ballroom dance in 3/4 time done to the music of the &ldquo;Some Nights&rdquo; band = FUN. WALTZ = FAULTS ONE = F</li>
    <li>Expression intending to cause injury that costs no money = FREE THREAT = FRET THREE = E</li>
    <li>Way to raise money for charity by collecting cellulars from people = PHONE DRIVE = DRONE FIVE = E </li>
    <li>Onion-related herb that has been placed in the proper folder = FILED CHIVE = CHILD FIVE = D</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Then if you take each of the letters in order that you get from indexing with the number into the other word, you get &ldquo;SPOONERIZED WIREFEED&rdquo; which gives the answer, <b>FIREWEED</b>.</p>
