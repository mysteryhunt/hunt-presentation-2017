      This puzzle centers on <i>Cabin Pressure</i>, a BBC radio sitcom about a small
      (one-plane) charter airline, MJN Air. Each of the twenty-six episodes is named for
      a city beginning with a different letter of the alphabet. A recurring
      element has the members of its crew playing small games, to pass the time
      and/or compete with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The puzzle gives a collection of ten mini-puzzles. Each is based on a game
      played by one or more members of the crew in one episode. Solving each
      mini-puzzle gives three letters; stringing all letters together gives the
      phrase EPISODES MJN AIR PLAYED THESE GAMES. Identifying the relevant
      episodes and concatenating their starting letters gives the final
      answer, <b>DWARF SUMAC</b>.

      (D) Finding a workable set of slider values will get the cricket ball past
      each of the three batsmen to hit the wicket; the number revealed on the
      batsman&rsquo;s uniform indicates an index into the batsman&rsquo;s name, and the
      number of stumps knocked down gives the ordering of the three letters
      (EPI). In the episode &ldquo;Douz,&rdquo; the first officer plays cricket with the
      members of a Scottish cricket team.
    </p>
    <p>
      (W) These are famous quotations expressed in words of one syllable (&ldquo;Don't
      worry about the world coming to an end today. It&rsquo;s already tomorrow in
      Australia&rdquo;, Charles Schulz; &ldquo;All animals are equal, but some animals are
      more equal than others&rdquo;, George Orwell; &ldquo;The greatest happiness is to know
      the source of unhappiness&rdquo;, Fyodor Dostoevsky); the first letters of the
      authors&rsquo; names give SOD. In the episode &ldquo;Wokingham,&rdquo; the crew compete to
      see who can go the longest speaking exclusively in words of one syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A) These cryptic clues indicate three famous Britons with the first name
      Brian (Brian Eno, Brian Reffin Smith, Brian May); the first letters of
      their last names give ESM. In the episode &ldquo;Abu Dhabi,&rdquo; the captain and
      first officer play a game naming &ldquo;Brians of Britain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (R) Drawing a line from each item on the left to the city that rhymes with
      it on the right (fork/York; gnome/Rome; hibachi/Karachi; kidney/Sydney;
      trombone/Cologne; Zima/Lima) results in intersections at three of the
      letters: from top left to bottom right, JNA. In the episode &ldquo;Rotterdam,&rdquo;
      the captain and first officer play a game of &ldquo;Through Customs&rdquo; with such
      rhymes.

      (F) The phrases describe titles of books missing their last letter: <i>The
      Gift of the Mag(I)</i>, <i>The Silver Chai(R)</i>, <i>The World According to Gar(P)</i>. In
      the episode &ldquo;Fitton,&rdquo; the crew plays &ldquo;Books That Sound More Interesting
      with the Final Letter Knocked Off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (S) These itineraries go from one city to another in rhyming pairs
      (Chester to Leicester; Tehran to Amman; Petaluma to Yuma); the first
      letters of the destination cities give LAY. In the episode &ldquo;St
      Petersburg,&rdquo; the captain and first officer play a game of &ldquo;Rhyming
      Journeys.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      (U) The first two letters of each traveler&rsquo;s name are the symbol of an
      element on the periodic table; taking the last initials of the three
      corresponding to metals gives EDT. In the episode &ldquo;Uskerty,&rdquo; the steward
      plays a &ldquo;game&rdquo; of seeing if the security gate can tell if someone is
      carrying metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      (M) The clue phrases point to filling in the blanks with HAYSTACK
      MOUNTAIN, EASTER ISLAND STATUES, STAR WARS CANTINA; the first letters of
      those answers give HES; the highlighted blanks in each one spell SANTA. In
      the episode &ldquo;Molokai,&rdquo; the crew does a Secret Santa gift exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A) The &ldquo;word list&rdquo; gives a set of vessels, whose captains can be fit into
      the criss-cross. The marked boxes in the result, from top to bottom, give
      EGA. Through the episode &ldquo;Abu Dhabi,&rdquo; the first officer names famous
      captains whom the plane&rsquo;s captain has never heard of.

      (C) This cabin address incorporates passages from three Frank Sinatra
      songs: &ldquo;My Way,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ever Homeward,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strangers in the Night.&rdquo; The first
      letters of those titles give MES. In the episode &ldquo;Cremona,&rdquo; the captain
      and first officer give cabin addresses over the intercom using the lyrics
      of Frank Sinatra songs.
