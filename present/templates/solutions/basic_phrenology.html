    <p>
      The solver is presented with two images of heads, and 33 TIL statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s possible to trans-delete a word in each statement to make it
      true. For example, &ldquo;A man began to hiccup after a goth fell on him, and he
      wasn't able to stop until 68 years later.&rdquo; GOTH = HOG + T.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these statements are facts that can be found within TED-Ed
      videos. The 33 cells within the first image of the head all contain stills
      from those same videos. Identify them. The head image can be found at the
      beginning of every TED-Ed video.
    </p>
    <p>
      Place the added letters from the TILâ€™s into the second image of the head,
      in the corresponding spot to the still from that video. For example, the
      lower left still is from the video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMMPYkRrd4o">&ldquo;Could we actually
      live on Mars?&rdquo;</a>. The added letter in that video was a T (TRAMS = MARS +
      T), so place a T in that spot in the second head image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading off the 33 letters in the order suggested by the black dots
      between cells in the second image yields the clue phrase: TIL HANDS CAN
      COUNT USING BIRYANI AT END.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iterate on the trans-deletion technique to get TIL HANDS CAN COUNT USING
      BINARY AT END.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a reference to the TED-Ed
      video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UixU1oRW64Q">&ldquo;How high can
      you count on your fingers?&rdquo;</a>. At the end of that video
      (at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UixU1oRW64Q&t=237s">time
      3:57</a>), solvers will find 13 hands around a computer chip, cycling
      through a sequence of binary finger positions. Either by pausing, or
      focusing on an individual hand going through the full sequence, solvers
      can translate the binary into decimal, then into letters (00011 = 3 = C),
      yielding the answer <b>CRANIOGRAPHER</b>.
