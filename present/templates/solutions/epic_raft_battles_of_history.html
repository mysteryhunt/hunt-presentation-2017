      Each of the puzzle's ten images features a famous Viking, some rap lyrics,
      and a map. The lyrics feature clues to identify:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Viking (the enumeration is also provided)
      <li>A Viking River Cruise (www.vikingrivercruises.com; these are
        explicitly named in the lyrics)
      <li>Two locations that are stops on the named cruise (these are also marked on the map with the Viking Cruise Line ship logos)
    </ul>
    <p>
      The maps show the river routes of the cruises. The words START and FINISH
      are included to indicate the direction of the cruise, as some Viking River
      Cruises can start at either end of their route. The two locations clued in
      each set of lyrics are stops that occur on particular days of the cruise's
      itinerary. Indexing the days into the name of the Viking produces two
      letters. The indexed letters spell the phrase BOAT POLES OR HAS A
      FIGHT. This clues the answer <b>SPARS</b>.
