    These are all paths through the 11 undergraduate dorms at MIT. Solvers
    need to figure out which dorm is which and use the internet and the dorm
    floor plans (available with Kerberos access at mit.edu) to trace the path
    followed to the suspect&rsquo;s room. Take the indicated numbers of the room,
    convert to letters and sort by dorm name to spell the answer: <b>PAVING
    TILE</b>.

	<p>The following insights might help solvers who struggle to figure out which recording corresponds to which dorm:</p>
	<ul>
  	<li>The front desk or &ldquo;desk&rdquo; of each dorm is often located close to the main entrance and it is usually labeled on the floorpan with OFF or OFFICE.</li>
  	<li>The following dorms could be said to be separated into sections: East Campus, Burton Conner, New House, McGregor, Simmons.</li>
  	<li>Did you know that East Campus has an underground tunnel connecting the two parallels? Neat!</li>
	</ul>

    A transcript of each clip and a map of the starting path within each dorm are shown below.
