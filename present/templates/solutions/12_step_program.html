    The circular image at the bottom of the page is an outline of the Bhavacakraâ€”the Buddhist Wheel of Life. Traditional representations of the bhavacakra include the twelve nidanas around the outer rim.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of the movie stills aligns with one of the images traditionally associated with the nidanas. (The traditional images do have several variations, but the set of images chosen should have only one set of associations that places all 12 in one of the outer rim locations.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The numbers in the outer rim are used to index into the associated movie title, as shown in the table below.
