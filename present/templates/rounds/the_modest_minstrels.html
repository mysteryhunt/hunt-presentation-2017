{% block round_flavortext %}
<p>Entering an unfamiliar village, you and your fellow travelers hear some music. Following the sound, you arrive at the town square where a group of minstrels is playing.</p>

<p>One of the townsfolk whispers to you, "Millius Vanillius may seem like a decent, modest band, but they harbor a secret." You inquire further into the nature of this secret, but the townsman says "Go ask the woman playing the finger cymbals--perhaps she will tell you what you want to know".</p>

<p>After they finish playing their tunes, the band hands out pie with ice cream to the listeners. As you enjoy your dessert, you strike up a conversation with the cymbal player and ask her what deep secret the band is hiding. She is reluctant to tell you, but eventually confesses.</p>

<p><span class="round_question">What does she tell you about the modest minstrels?</span></p>
