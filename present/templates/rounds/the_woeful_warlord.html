<p>The warlord looks sadly at his map of the battlefield. "Thank goodness you're here," he exclaims. "I need a combat strategy. My enemy and I have exhausted every angle, every avenue for attack. It's all so complicated: Where should I attack next? How will my enemy respond?" He collapses in a heap, overwhelmed by the pressure. It doesn't look like he'll be able to win this war on his own.</p>
