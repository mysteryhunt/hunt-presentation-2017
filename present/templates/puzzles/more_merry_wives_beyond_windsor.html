      CHORUS: We merry wives do hail from sea to sea,<br>
      now shall we introduce ourselves to thee!
    </p>
    <p>
      AULA: How now, I have returned to share enlight-<br>
      enment. Kind greetings, common wenches all!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLOVIET: Thou mustn&rsquo;t loathe me for that I am fair;<br>
      and yet, as I keep hither, do despise.
    </p>
    <p>
      CYUNA: Me, once I was a beggar, thence found wealth<br>
      thence fell to beggary once more; &rsquo;tis true<br>
      wealth brings facility.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOSY: Forsooth I earn-<br>
      eth not my wage, though riches I do heart-<br>
      ily dispense.

      to herdsmen, in this Meadow Town,<br>
      aside the field I doth not tarry.
    </p>

      FLIASTA: Yea,<br>
      t&rsquo;were I a spade, mine edge indeed may lack<br>
      acuity, yet bonny still I be.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLIELE: Most verily, attractiveness is might,<br>
      but one must wield it with ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      HANNORY: But above all: do proffer prettily<br>
      your truth, and tote accessories in style.
    </p>
    <p>
      ISLIDA: And yet, to cast this young fowl to a lair<br>
      of catamounts, such thing would make great sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHORUS: Thou finds&rsquo;t our homes arranged from A to P,<br>
      And learn another wife&rsquo;s identity!
