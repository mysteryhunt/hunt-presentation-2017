  <ul>
    <li>Fiona looked up from cleaning the bakeshop to see Henry, the hapless cobbler who lived down the lane.</li>
    <li>"What brings you by, Henry?"</li>
    <li>"I thought you... I wondered if... er... I ..." He trailed off into an odd grunt.</li>
    <li>Fiona raised an eyebrow. Henry dropped his shoulders in a nervous slump.</li>
    <li>She took pity. "Well, I'll be glad of the company while I finish. I don't suppose you'd like to do some scouring? All I have is this execrable sponge and I'm about fed up."</li>
    <li>Just then, in came Smug Betty, the gossip, who looked knowingly from Henry to Fiona and back again. "Why Fiona, you reprehensible tart," she said.</li>
    <li>"Pish tosh," said Fiona, adjusting her apron's crooked buckle. "I don't know what you're talking about."</li>
    <li>Henry finally found his tongue. "Even an officious fool like you should know that I only came here to order dessert."</li>
  </ul>
