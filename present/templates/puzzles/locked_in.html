      You&rsquo;re weightless, floating in a massive space roughly the size of a
      football stadium. There are some geometric shapes floating here and there,
      and blue laser beams flying through the air. You try to orient
      yourself. Okay, you left the last place through the floor, but it seemed
      like you entered this place through a wall. There&rsquo;s a bright light at the
      other end of the chamber. A young boy zips past you and shouts &ldquo;Hey, the
      gate to escape is down!&rdquo; That was actually helpful. You point your feet at
      the bright light, push off the wall, and drift towards the light. Halfway
      there, you grab a laser gun that&rsquo;s floated by. You play around with it and
      accidentally shoot yourself in the leg. Oops. You feel your muscles freeze
      up. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because you&rsquo;re on the right course! You drift
      through the bright light .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      The timer on your wrist starts counting down from 60:00, and you begin
      your journey. Whoa, it&rsquo;s hot. A filthy man with a cockney accent demands
      to know what you&rsquo;re doing here. You shrug and grab a lump of coal off a
      pile. You notice some items that seem out of place-- one of those those
      little metal star-shaped toys with six little knobs, and a red, fragrant,
      thorny flower. Before you can investigate them, the lights flicker then go
      out entirely. Water starts flowing in through the walls. Ow ow ow, that is
      cold! A heavy metal door is now slowly lowering over the only egress. You
      wade towards it as fast as you can, but you&rsquo;re not going to be fast
      enough. The filthy man gets there ahead of you and nobly braces his body
      in the door frame. He slows it down just long enough for you to dive into
      the water and swim under .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      Wherever you are, it is abundantly clear that there is no intercourse
      allowed. You know this because there are signs. So many signs. Some quite
      graphic. And they all indicate one thing: no copulation. It&rsquo;s not as if
      you were planning to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anyhow, it&rsquo;s a pretty nice place. There are some
      plush couches and a few metal poles that are almost certainly not load-bearing.
      Hmm. Against one wall are a bunch of zodiac signs and a series of
      morbid horoscopes. Oh, but you find a few typos in them, and together they
      spell &ldquo;Make it rain.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re not sure what that means, but you find a
      bottle of Dom Perignon, so you shake it up, remove the cork, and spray it
      all over the room. When it splashes up onto a photo of pumas, the fabric
      tears, and a key falls to your feet. You pick up the key. It&rsquo;s all wet,
      but you remedy that with an object you&rsquo;ve been carrying for almost 40
      minutes. You use the key to unlock the only door, push it open, and
      exit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      You&rsquo;re soaking wet. It&rsquo;s very unpleasant. You&rsquo;re in some kind of massive
      garden, and pretty much everything seems edible. You&rsquo;re about taste some
      tree bark when a strange group of men file in and perform a rhyming song
      about your misfortune. One of them brings you a towel, and you dry
      yourself off. You keep the towel. While exploring, you uncover a keyboard
      inside a hollow stump. As you start experimenting with it, the men sing
      the overture from a Mozart opera; you think it&rsquo;s the one about a
      wedding. You play the tune on the keyboard, and a door swings open. You
      step through .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      You&rsquo;re standing at the beginning of some sort of obstacle course. There&rsquo;s
      a glassed-in overhanging control booth, and the interior designer must&rsquo;ve
      really loved the letter &ldquo;X,&rdquo; because it appears on every surface. This
      place doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been designed for an ordinary human. Everything
      climbable is unreasonably high, and there are massive gaps that require
      jumping across. And more lasers. Not those tame muscle-stiffening lasers
      from five locations ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these lasers look like they&rsquo;d cut clean through
      you. The walls are pretty beat up; some parts are scorched, others seem
      frozen solid, and there are criss-crossing claw marks all over the place
      in groups of three. On the closest wall you notice a sequence of them that
      you could use as handholds. You nervously climb up, wedging your fingers
      and shoes into these abrasions. When you reach the top you squeeze your
      way through a hole in the ceiling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      The first thing you notice here is the rug. It&rsquo;s way more interesting than
      the carpet in the place you just left. It&rsquo;s covered in a zigzag pattern of
      thick lines alternating burgundy and white. The whole place is ringed by
      curtains, and there are a few black chairs, two lamps, and the <i>Venus de
      Milo</i>. You&rsquo;re admiring it when you hear something behind you. There&rsquo;s a
      very small man. He claps his hands and says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rock!&rdquo; His words and
      movements all seem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. off .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a way you can&rsquo;t identify. There&rsquo;s a
      predatory bird in the corner, looking at you curiously. You get the
      distinct impression it&rsquo;s not what it seems. You feel something squirming
      in your pocket that you remember picking up nine locations ago. You
      release it on the floor, and it heads for the curtains. Just as it gets
      there, the bird swoops down, catches it in its claws, and crashes into the
      curtain. In that spot, a shimmering portal appears. You see on your watch
      that you&rsquo;re down to your last ten seconds, so you sprint towards it. You
      pass through. On the other side, you&rsquo;re greeted by some guy named Bob. He
      hands you a deerstalker cap and a chalkboard with &ldquo;00:01&rdquo; written on it,
      and leads you to a wall where he takes your picture.

      You&rsquo;re in a totally empty space. You can walk again, but your legs are
      still pretty sore from what just happened. Before you can explore, a
      smarmy looking blonde kid wearing black robes busts in, clutching a
      stick. The space transforms itself into a storage facility, overflowing
      with towering heaps of junk. For lack of any better ideas, you follow the
      kid, who occasionally pauses to point his stick at inanimate objects and
      shout in Latin. He opens a wardrobe, climbs in, and shuts the door behind
      him. You wait a moment, then yank the door open. He&rsquo;s gone! You follow his
      example. When the door opens again, you&rsquo;re somewhere else .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      Oh man, this place is just super distressing. There&rsquo;s, like, torture
      equipment all over the place. Someone could really get hurt on this
      stuff. That&rsquo;s probably why there are so many security cameras on the
      walls. Nice to know someone&rsquo;s watching .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.? A rat scurries across the
      floor. You think he&rsquo;s cute, so you put him in your pocket. Whoever says
      rats are the worst thing in the world ought to be shot. One wall is
      covered in words, including &ldquo;Thought,&rdquo; &ldquo;Slavery,&rdquo; &ldquo;Duck,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crime,&rdquo; and
      many others. On a whim you use something that you picked up two locations
      ago to connect two of the words-- which also appear in a famous Tolstoy
      title-- with a crude black mark. A hidden panel pops open, and you hurry
      out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      Ding! You&rsquo;ve arrived. The door slides open and you step into a metal
      chamber. It seems to be a movie theater for one person. You take a seat in
      an uncomfortable leather chair, and a movie begins. It&rsquo;s not a very good
      film. Very, very quick cuts, some not-so-inspirational slogans and bible
      references, the moon, a doll, some stairs, gross looking pasta .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. weird
      choices. But man, does it have a dope-ass beat. You&rsquo;re starting to groove
      out when you hear a whisper say, &ldquo;We have to go back.&rdquo; You look around,
      but there&rsquo;s no one there. Anyhow, there definitely isn&rsquo;t enough time left
      to go all the way back to the start. Well, sick drum solo notwithstanding,
      it&rsquo;s time to get out of this creepy place. You find, against a wall, an
      octagonal bagua carving. You use clues you picked up in the movie to push
      some hidden switches, and the whole thing swings open. You crawl
      through .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      This is the first location where you feel physically comfortable from the
      start. It&rsquo;s a nice, oak-panelled study. Two gentlemen wearing white wigs
      sit at a table. One of them talks really fast. No one else is in here, but
      through a window you can see a man singing, dancing, and rapping with
      great urgency. One of the gentlemen suggests that you can solve one
      problem with another. They gesture to the table, and you take a seat,
      diametrically opposed to where they&rsquo;re sitting. There&rsquo;s a map of the US
      (with only thirteen states) and an elaborate sliding puzzle that involves
      moving a piece from New York to Washington, DC. Once you complete the
      puzzle, you hear a click, and a trapdoor opens in the floor. You climb
      through .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      You emerge through a hatch in the floor of an elongated space with blue
      carpeting. You haven&rsquo;t seen any live human actors in the last four
      locations, but this one more than makes up for it. There are a dozen or so
      men and women in suits (some decorated with medals and ribbons) walking
      and talking around the table in pairs and trios. They&rsquo;re yammering so fast
      you can hardly make out anything they&rsquo;re saying. Something about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
      president getting into a bicycle accident? Free college tuition? Someone
      named Josh being in love with his assistant? There&rsquo;s a map of the world on
      one wall, covered in symbols. You connect matching symbols with pushpins
      and string, and find that the strings all overlap over an island in the
      middle of the Atlantic. You poke your finger into the map at that spot and
      find a secret button. As you press the button, the map rises into the
      ceiling, revealing an opening. You step through .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

      Great, another empty space! Oh, no, wait, there&rsquo;s a large black predatory
      cat. He&rsquo;s baring some nasty-looking fangs at you. Now he&rsquo;s pacing back and
      forth and arching his back. Crap. You remember that you&rsquo;re carrying two
      things that could be useful in a situation like this. You pick one, pull
      the trigger, and the cat goes bounding off into the distance, chasing a
      blue dot. Phew. Okay, now what? You look at your watch, and a little over
      half of your time has elapsed. There are no walls visible, so you choose a
      random direction and start walking. Eventually you reach an elevator, just
      sitting there. Inside, there are two names embossed on the wall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is this
      a law firm? There&rsquo;s Muzak playing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it sounds like a cover of Neil
      Young&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vampire Blues,&rdquo; but with soul. The elevator buttons are flashing
      intermittently. You play a game of Simon with them, matching the flashing
      sequence. After several rounds the buttons all give one final flash, and a
      previously invisible button lights up. You press it, and the elevator
      descends through the floor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
