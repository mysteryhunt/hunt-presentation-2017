    Ensuring the health and safety of all Mystery Hunt participants is a top priority. As the leaders of your teams, you are primarily responsible for handling emergencies and for ensuring the overall health and safety of team members (or designating a responsible team member for that role).
  </p>
  <p>
    This document contains important information and helpful tips. Read it, learn it, share it, live it. Thanks for your attention.

  <div class="standard-horizontal-scroll">USE COMMON SENSE</div>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a puzzle-solving competition, not a mountain-climbing expedition. There is no reason for anyone to put themselves at risk of being harmed, arrested, or held liable for any property damage. Our actions will also reflect on the Mystery Hunt as a whole, so let&rsquo;s stay safe and responsible both for our own sakes and for the sake of everyone who loves the Mystery Hunt and cares about its future.</li>
    <li><b>Follow our instructions.</b> During hunt, we will communicate any important health and safety information on the hunt website, by email, by phone, and in person if needed.</li>
    <li>Have a designated <b>&ldquo;Health &amp; Safety Marshal&rsquo;</b> who is familiar with this information and ready to respond if a problem arises while your team is hunting.</li>
    <li><b>If you think you are about to do something illegal, unsafe, against MIT policy or otherwise ill-advised, CALL HUNT HQ FIRST.</b></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="handbook-section">
  <div class="standard-horizontal-scroll">IMPORTANT CONTACT INFORMATION</div>
  <ul>
    <li><b>MIT Police:  617-253-1212</b> (or 100 from a campus phone). The MIT Police should be contacted in all emergencies, whether they are of a criminal, medical, or safety nature, or to report an encounter with a suspicious or dangerous person who is not participating in the hunt. The MIT Police will dispatch the appropriate resources, which in some cases might include the student-run MIT-EMS, who will have an ambulance on call.</li>
    <li><b>Hunt HQ Phone:  617-324-7732.</b>  Call during hunt if you encounter a &ldquo;real-life situation&rdquo; and you do not know what to do (e.g., a medical emergency, lost team member, encounter with police, damage to MIT property).</li>
    <li><b>Hunt Organizers E-mail:  puzzle@mit.edu.</b> All incidents should be reported by email after the immediate emergency or threat has been managed.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="handbook-section">
  <div class="standard-horizontal-scroll">ALERTS</div>
  <ul>
    <li><b>MIT Alert System:</b>  Provides real-time alerts for emergencies on campus. We added at least one contact per team just for Hunt weekend (via the Health &amp; Safety Quiz); to subscribe permanently, visit <a href="http://em2.mit.edu/mitalert/">http://em2.mit.edu/mitalert/</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Fire Alarms:</b>  If an alarm sounds, all team members must immediately stop working, walk out of the building through the nearest marked exit, and wait for further instructions.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="handbook-section">
  <div class="standard-horizontal-scroll">MEDICAL CARE</div>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Urgent Care:</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MIT affiliates</b> can use MIT Medical&rsquo;s Urgent Care in building E23 for non-emergency treatment, 7am-11pm. Overnight, call MIT Medical at 617-253-4481 to speak with a nurse, who can schedule a next-day appointment.</li>
        <li><b>Non-affiliates</b> should use area hospitals for urgent medical needs. Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge Hospital, and Mount Auburn Hospital are the closest.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>First Aid:</b> Hunt HQ will provide a kit to each team for treating minor issues.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="handbook-section">
  <div class="standard-horizontal-scroll">KNOW WHERE YOU ARE</div>
  <ul>
    <li><b>MIT is a real university</b>, and Mystery Hunt is not the only thing happening. Try not to disturb researchers, staff, and other activities that might be occurring on campus.</li>
    <li><b>Don&rsquo;t go anywhere or do anything illegal or unsafe.</b> The Mystery Hunt takes place in designated rooms, except where you might need to visit parts of campus that are accessible to the MIT community at large. Don&rsquo;t enter restricted areas unless someone from Hunt HQ lets you in. Don&rsquo;t force open locked doors or set off emergency alarms.</li>
    <li><b>Don&rsquo;t carry any weapon, or anything that looks like a weapon, on campus.</b></li>
    <li><b>Be careful with MIT property</b>, especially if your team is using an MIT room as its base. Damage to property will reflect poorly on the Mystery Hunt in general and will compromise your team&rsquo;s ability to use MIT rooms in the future.</li>
    <li><b>Some members of your team might not know MIT that well.</b> Before sending someone away from your team base, make sure you have a way to stay in touch with that person (and vice versa), and give the person a map if needed.</li>
    <li><b>If you think a team member is lost</b>, call them directly. If that fails, call Hunt HQ, and if we cannot help, contact MIT Police.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="handbook-section">
  <div class="standard-horizontal-scroll">STAY HEALTHY</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask if any of your team members have <b>allergies or other health conditions</b> that might require attention, and take appropriate precautions.</li>
    <li>Have team members make a <b>plan for getting sleep</b>. Mystery Hunt is a marathon, not a sprint. Note that MIT rules do not allow sleeping in classrooms. Make arrangements so that team members can sleep in dorms, hotels or nearby residences.</li>
    <li>Be sure team members <b>stay hydrated</b> and have <b>nutritious food</b> to eat over the course of the weekend. Not just Oreos and Mountain Dew.</b></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="handbook-section">
  <div class="standard-horizontal-scroll">MAINTAIN A HARASSMENT-FREE ENVIRONMENT</div>
  <ul>
    <li>The MIT Mystery Hunt is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</li>
    <li>MIT policies expressly prohibit harassment, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, gender-based harassment and stalking. All teams and participants must abide by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/policies/9/9.4.html">MIT&rsquo;s Harassment Policy</a>. Hunt participants violating this policy may be expelled from Mystery Hunt at the organizers&rsquo; discretion.</li>
    <li>If you would like to report harassment, please remove yourself from the uncomfortable situation and contact Hunt HQ by phone or email.</li>
    <li>Team captains should make sure this policy is understood by all team members and should actively discourage harassment within and among teams.</li>
  </ul>
